Implementation of Network Intrusion Detection systems using Machine Learning Models.

Network Intrusion is an illicit practice quite prevalent in the world of today. Given the ubiquity of the internet, it is not practically feasible to manually counter all such attacks. Hence, I have tried to implement such a system, that, given appropriate training, would classify attacks as threats or innocuous.

I try to implement various ML models for this, and compare the accuracies in each so as to find out which might be the best model for deploying on a large scale.

Models I plan to use are:
* Native Bayes
* Decision Tree
* K-means Clustering

* Dushyant Pathak
